# Login By pass

## Problem: 
In this code, we can see the creation of database with some datas in it. Three tables are created wich are users, sessions and articles. Then, we insert user in this table. The values are very simple, "admin" for the login, "admin123" for the password. Even if people don't know these informations, they can just force it by trying random and simple logs.

## Solution: 
Insert logs with more complexitude
