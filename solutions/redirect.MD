# redict

## Problem: 
Do not let the user control what's inside the redirect. Even if you want to do a function for this. I consider that sha1 is too much predictible. It's also adding execute time to the code even if it's a little bit

## Solution: 
You should hard write it or you can use symfony that contain bundle for those redirection.
